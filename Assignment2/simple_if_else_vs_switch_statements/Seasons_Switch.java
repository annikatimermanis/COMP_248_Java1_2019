/* This program uses a switch statement to allow a user to enter any number from 1-12, and outputs which month 
   it is in the Persian Calendar, the season it falls in and outputs a kind message associated with that season. 
   If the number entered is not between 1-12, then the program will tell you the input is invalid.*/
